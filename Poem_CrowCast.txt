# Crow Cast
## Inspired by the Tamil Moview -- Karnan starring Dhanush

- Crows are creative creatures, cramming unto its cradle
- Crows are weaving a wow, wings to waze, maze to mints
- Crows are waking up in a waze, willows, weeds, wokes 
- Crows are collecting cubicles, crystals, crematoriums 
- Cubicles of memory, myths, myriads of mayhems
- Cubicles of confessions, calculations, cojugations
- Crows are sometimes casted in correlated colors 
- Crows have cicumference too
- Crows of past were scavengers
- Crows of past were humming birds
- Crows of cast were pandemonic 
- Crows of today are pandemic
- Crows of tomorrow will be sailors
- Crows cast fast on a ghost river
- Crows cast haste on crimson hexagon
- Crows cast cruleties on crux of crimes 
- Crows cast conjugal crisis for climate
